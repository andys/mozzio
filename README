mozzio - Portable C device I/O benchmark
----------------------------------------


Feature list:

* tests and reports:
	1. large-bock sequential read,
	2. and write
	3. small-block random I/O read,
	4. and write

* uncompressible and non-dedupable data for random IO tests

* supports multi-threaded concurrent I/O tests 

* configurable from slow hard disks to fast SSD RAIDs

* compiles and runs properly across OSX, Linux, BSD, and OpenSolaris



How to use:
-----------

$ gcc -lpthread -O3 -o mozzio mozzio.c

$ ./mozzio  

Defaults to a 10G file. On linux, run it as root with sudo, to allow
automatic dropping of VM caches between runs.


Wishlist:
---------

* support raw devices 

* run across multiple hosts

* auto-size the parameters

* support test data modes for: 
	- uncompressible vs compressible
	- de-dupable vs non-de-dupable
