mozzio - Portable C device I/O benchmark
----------------------------------------


Feature list / Wishlist:

* test and report large-bock sequential and small-block random I/O speed

* support files as well as raw devices

* compile and run on any unix operating system

* be configurable to scale from slow hard disks to big fast SSD RAIDs

* support a number of workers to test multi-threaded concurrent I/O performance



Currently, v0.1 it only supports writing a large file and measuring sequential
read/write, and then testing 4kB small block random I/O, all in a single
thread.
