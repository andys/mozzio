mozzio - Portable C device I/O benchmark
----------------------------------------


Feature list:

* tests and reports:
	1. large-bock sequential read,
	2. and write
	3. small-block random I/O read,
	4. and write

* uncompressible and non-dedupable data for random IO tests

* supports multi-threaded concurrent I/O tests 

* configurable from slow hard disks to fast SSD RAIDs

* compiles and runs properly across OSX,linux,BSD


Wishlist:

* support raw devices 

* run across multiple hosts

* auto-size the parameters

* support test data for: 
	- uncompressible vs compressible
	- de-dupable vs non-de-dupable
